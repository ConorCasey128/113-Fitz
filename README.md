# Texas Holdem Poker

## What the project is

We'ere building our own version of the popular Texas Holdem, whilst trying to learn web development.
The goal is to make a fully playable, single-player game with a clean UI, proper logic and eventually some AI opponents.

## The Plan

### MVP

- Working deck with shuffling
- Dealing functionality
- Betting logic (check, call, fold, raise)
- Community cards + flow (preflop -> flop -> turn -> river)
- Showdown and winner calc

### Next Steps

- Basic AI logic for opponent simulation
- Chip tracking + pot logic
- Simple UI polish (animations, cards flipping and chips stacking)

### Endgame Goals

- Side pots
- Multiple opponents
- Multiplayer online
